# Gene Keys Witness Prompt Examples

## Consciousness Level Adaptation

Gene Keys witness prompts adapt to three consciousness phases:
- **Shadow (0-2)**: Witnessing unconscious patterns
- **Gift (3-4)**: Conscious expression awareness  
- **Siddhi (5-6)**: Transcendent awareness

---

## Example Chart

**4 Activation Sequences**:
- Life's Work: 17 (Opinion → Far-Sightedness → Omniscience) + 18 (Judgment → Integrity → Perfection)
- Evolution: 45 (Dominance → Synergy → Communion) + 26 (Manipulation → Artistry → Invisibility)
- Radiance: 17 + 45
- Purpose: 18 + 26

---

## Shadow Prompts (Level 0-2)

**Focus**: Witnessing unconscious reactive patterns

### Example 1: Life's Work + Evolution
```
What unconscious patterns drive your sense of purpose? 
How do the shadows of Opinion (17) and Judgment (18) shape what you believe you must do? 
When Dominance (45) operates unconsciously, what recurring patterns do you notice in your growth journey?
```

### Example 2: Evolution focus
```
What shadow themes recur in your growth journey? 
Notice when Dominance (45) and Manipulation (26) arise—what happens before awareness enters? 
Can you witness the pattern without needing to change it?
```

### Example 3: Life's Work shadow recognition
```
When Opinion (17) hardens into certainty, what do you notice in your body? 
How does the shadow of Judgment (18) reveal itself through your sense of purpose? 
What happens when you simply witness these patterns without trying to fix them?
```

**Key Features**:
- Non-judgmental observation language
- "What do you notice?" framing
- Focus on recognition before change
- Body-based awareness cues

---

## Gift Prompts (Level 3-4)

**Focus**: Conscious expression and interplay of gifts

### Example 1: Radiance + Purpose integration
```
How do your conscious gifts Far-Sightedness (17) and Synergy (45) create your core magnetism? 
When you're most authentic, what happens in the interplay between Integrity (18) and Artistry (26) as your higher calling reveals itself? 
What invitation lives in the space between Opinion becoming Far-Sightedness and Judgment becoming Integrity?
```

### Example 2: Life's Work expression
```
How do Far-Sightedness (17) and Integrity (18) dance together in your conscious purpose? 
When you witness their gifts emerging, what quality of presence arises? 
What wants to be expressed through this unique combination?
```

### Example 3: Radiance exploration
```
What core identity shines when Far-Sightedness (17) and Synergy (45) align in your Radiance? 
How does this magnetism feel different from trying to be someone? 
When these gifts are fully expressed, who is living through you?
```

**Key Features**:
- "How do gifts dance together?" framing
- Authenticity and expression focus
- Invitation-based language
- Integration between sequences

## Siddhi Prompts (Level 5-6)

**Focus**: Transcendent awareness beyond personal identity

### Example 1: Purpose transcendence
```
Beyond the personal purpose of Integrity and Artistry, what transcendent awareness is seeking recognition? 
When the siddhis of Perfection (Gene Key 18) and Invisibility (Gene Key 26) dissolve into unity, what remains? 
How does Omniscience (Gene Key 17) become a doorway to the infinite expressing as the finite?
```

### Example 2: Ultimate realization
```
When Opinion (17) completes its journey to Omniscience, what is looking through these eyes? 
As Perfection (18) and Invisibility (26) merge beyond personal purpose, what transcendent truth reveals itself? 
Who or what remains when all sense of doing dissolves into pure Being?
```

### Example 3: Divine recognition
```
What seeks to be realized beyond the self through Omniscience (17), Perfection (18), and Invisibility (26)? 
When these three siddhis converge, what quality of consciousness recognizes itself? 
How does the formless express through the specificity of your unique Gene Keys?
```

**Key Features**:
- "Beyond personal purpose" framing
- Unity consciousness language
- Dissolution of doer/seeker
- Formless-form integration
- "What is looking?" inquiries

## Prompt Construction Principles

### 1. Always Inquiry Format
- End with "?"
- Open-ended, not leading
- Invite discovery, not answers

### 2. Reference Specific Gene Keys
- Include key numbers
- Name Shadow/Gift/Siddhi frequencies
- Connect to activation sequences

### 3. Adapt to Consciousness Level
- Meet person where they are
- Don't rush to transcendence
- Honor Shadow work as foundational

### 4. Use Active Sequences
- Life's Work: Conscious purpose (Personality Sun + Earth)
- Evolution: Unconscious growth (Design Sun + Earth)
- Radiance: Core identity (Personality Sun + Design Sun)
- Purpose: Higher calling (Personality Earth + Design Earth)

### 5. Layer Context
- Body sensations (Shadow)
- Expression qualities (Gift)
- Transcendent awareness (Siddhi)

## Template Patterns

### Shadow Template
```
What unconscious patterns drive [Life's Work theme]?
How do [Shadow 1] and [Shadow 2] shape [specific behavior]?
When [Shadow 3] operates unconsciously, what [specific inquiry]?
```

### Gift Template
```
How do [Gift 1] and [Gift 2] create [Radiance quality]?
When you're most authentic, what happens in [Gift interplay]?
What invitation lives in [Shadow → Gift transformation]?
```

### Siddhi Template
```
Beyond [personal purpose description], what transcendent awareness [seeks recognition]?
When [Siddhi 1] and [Siddhi 2] [merge/dissolve/converge], what [remains/reveals/recognizes]?
How does [Siddhi] become [doorway/expression/recognition]?
```

## Usage in API

```bash
# Shadow prompts
curl -X POST /api/v1/engines/gene-keys/calculate \
  -d '{"options": {"consciousness_level": 1, "hd_gates": {...}}}'

# Gift prompts (default)
curl -X POST /api/v1/engines/gene-keys/calculate \
  -d '{"options": {"consciousness_level": 3, "hd_gates": {...}}}'

# Siddhi prompts
curl -X POST /api/v1/engines/gene-keys/calculate \
  -d '{"options": {"consciousness_level": 6, "hd_gates": {...}}}'
```

---

## Notes

- Prompts should never provide answers, only deepen inquiry
- Reference the specific numbers (e.g., "Gene Key 17") for grounding
- Use poetic/archetypal language while staying precise
- Consciousness level is self-reported; prompts guide the inquiry
- Fallback to Gift level (3) if consciousness_level missing or invalid
